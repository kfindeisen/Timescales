<h1>Timescales Read-Me</h1>

<p>The Timescales library provides basic functions for lightcurve analysis. The target application is automated reduction of large time-series data sets. While intended for use on Unix-like systems, Timescales is designed to be built and run on any platform.</p>

<p>The library is organized as a series of global functions under the kpftimes namespace, rather than as an object heirarchy. This architecture was chosen for its simplicity: each function performs a single, narrowly defined task, making it (hopefully!) easy to chain functions together into pipelines.</p>

<p>More information, including installation instructions, can be found in the Timescales Library Reference Manual, provided with the source distribution in <a href="doc/html/index.html">HTML</a> and <a href="doc/latex/refman.pdf">PDF</a> format.</p>
